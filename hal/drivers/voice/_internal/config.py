#                 digital silence for the whole reply and has nothing to detect.
#   "cancelled" — send the cancelled frame, and substitute silence only for
#                 frames the canceller could not vouch for. TRUE full duplex —
#                 but only as good as the reference: every frame where the
#                 reference FIFO underran is still substituted, and on a device
#                 where that is most of them the provider still hears mostly
#                 silence. Measured on lamp-ee17 2026-09-08: 50-99% of playback
#                 frames underran ("reference UNDERRAN on 170 frames" against
#                 27 cancelled), so `cancelled` alone does NOT restore barge-in
#                 there. Check the ERLE log before assuming it will.
#   "always"    — never substitute during playback; hand the provider every
#                 frame and let ITS VAD separate the user from our own echo.
#                 The only mode in which provider-native barge-in can work on a
#                 device with a starving reference, and the least safe: with
#                 low ERLE the model hears its own onsets as the user and cuts

# 25269, against a real-interruption floor of 6956. The provider's VAD sees
# peaks and has no echo defence of its own (it cannot see uncancelled(), and
# it applies no duration floor), so it reads the device's own onsets as the
